# ATM Simulation System in Python
PYTHON

This is a simple ATM simulation program built using Python that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, PIN change, and transaction history. The system uses file handling and maintains transaction history for each session.

## Features:
- **Balance Inquiry:** Allows the user to check their current balance.
- **Withdraw Cash:** Allows the user to withdraw cash if there are sufficient funds.
- **Deposit Cash:** Enables the user to deposit money into their account.
- **Change PIN:** The user can change their PIN for added security.
- **Transaction History:** Displays a history of all transactions (withdrawals and deposits).
- **Security:** The system provides basic security features such as PIN validation and account lock after 3 failed attempts.

## Functionalities:
1. **Balance Inquiry:** Displays the current account balance.
2. **Withdrawal:** Allows users to withdraw an amount if there are sufficient funds.
3. **Deposit:** Allows users to deposit money into their account.
4. **Change PIN:** Enables the user to change their PIN after verifying the old PIN.
5. **Transaction History:** Displays a list of all transactions, including withdrawals and deposits, for the current session.
6. **Exit:** The user can exit the system at any time.

## Security:
- The ATM system allows only 3 incorrect PIN attempts. After 3 failed attempts, the account will be locked for security reasons.
